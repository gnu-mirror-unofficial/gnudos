@cindex Mino Overview

What is mino (Mino)?
Mino is a GNU software, part of the GnuDOS package.@*
Mino is a text file editor for use with the GNU/Linux console/xterm. The idea 
was to provide a text editor that is user friendly and easy to use for those 
who came from DOS land. Having accustomed to SHIFT selecting text, using 
CTRL-shortcut keys and so on makes it hard for a regular Joe to dive in head
first into GNU syntax. Mino provides multi-level experience, the level of
complexity can be adjusted by the user: you want to use DOS-keys with a few
basic GNU ones? you want to go with the full power of the GNU system? All are
options that are provided by the six levels of experience of Mino:

@enumerate
@item
Newbie: All DOS shortcut keys, no GNU keys yet
@item
Novice: DOS shortcut keys, some of which are replaced with GNU's
@item
Intermediate: DOS keys with a few more replaced with GNU keys
@item
Advanced: ... And more GNU keys in
@item
Expert: Very few DOS keys, most are GNU keys
@item
Veteran: Only GNU keys, no DOS-like keys
@end enumerate
  
You start with level 1 by default.
To set your level, call the mino with @code{'--levelX'} or @code{'-lX'} options,
Where X is the level desired, for example:
@example
$mino --level2
@end example

@cindex Key bindings
@heading Which keys are defined for which level?
Below is a table showing the DOS-like key combinations along with their 
respective GNU key bindings. To the right is the level at which a certain GNU
key is defined. Each key defined is recognized in higher levels (e.g. level 2
keys are recognized in levels 3-4-5-6). Note that in level 6 only GNU keys are
defined, no DOS keys will work at this level!.

@b{Keybindings:}@*
In the table below, C-something means pressing down CTRL and then pressing the
other key. Note that '^' is the same as 'C', meaning CTRL key, it is just
typed like this so DOS users can feel familiar with the text.
The same as M-something, which means META or ALT.

@cindex Why to use it
@cindex Why to use mino
@cindex Reasons of using mino
If you are new to GNU system and find it hard to dive in head-first into the
GNU keys and shortcuts for GNU programs (like emacs), this is the place to
start. Use you well-known DOS-like shortcuts, in the same time learn how to
use the GNU shortcuts.

@heading How to run it?@*	
@cindex How to run mino
@cindex Running mino
@cindex Starting mino
@cindex Invoking mino

After installing the package, simply type:

@example
$ mino
@end example

on your console (or xterm) and it will run. If you want to load a file into mino:

@example
$ mino file-name
@end example

To reset the configuration file:

@example
$ mino --reset-config
@end example

@cindex Command line help
To show command line help:

@example
$ mino [--help|-h]
@end example

@heading How does mino remember my preferences?@*

Mino stores its configuration in a file called '.mino.conf' under your home
directory. You can edit it by hand (or using mino!), but this is not advisable.
Use the Options menu under mino to change your preferences and mino will save
them into the config file.

@cindex Sentence highlighting
@cindex Code highlighting
@cindex Highlighting mode
@heading What about sentence highlighting?@*

Currently mino recognizes the following file types:
@itemize
@item
C/C++ Source and header files
@item
Perl scripts
@item
Shell scripts
@end itemize

Whenever you open a file of these types, mino will automatically adjust the
colors of the view so that the language keywords, library functions, and
operators (like +-*/ and so on) are highlighted each in a different
color, on a black background, to ease writing your programs.

@heading What else?@*

There is one catch: when running under the X system, the program will not be
able to capture all input from the keyboard, as X interferes with the keyboard
input. Don't panic, this is not much of a deal. Plus, there is a workaround. 
The only thing you will be missing is the SHIFT-select. That means you will not
be able to hold down shift and use arrow keys to select text. The solution is
using CTRL+E under X, which activates the select mode. Enter select mode, use
arrow keys to size your selection, do whatever you want with it, and exit the
select mode. You want a permanent solution? Run mino under the Linux console!.@*

And that's it for intro!

@node Main Window
@chapter Mino main window
@cindex Main window

After running mino (Mino), you are faced with a window that has the following components:

@cindex Menu bar
